# Chapter 8: Human-Robot Interaction

## Overview

Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a critical aspect of humanoid robotics that focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of robots that can interact with humans in a natural and intuitive manner. This chapter explores the principles, technologies, and methodologies for creating effective human-robot interactions.

## Introduction to Human-Robot Interaction

Human-Robot Interaction is an interdisciplinary field that combines insights from robotics, psychology, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction. For humanoid robots, HRI is particularly important as their human-like form naturally invites social interaction.

### Why HRI is Critical for Humanoid Robots

- Effective human-robot teaming
- Shared workspace interaction
- Collaborative task execution

## Theoretical Foundations
