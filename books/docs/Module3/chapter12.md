# Chapter 12: Ethics and Safety

## Overview

As humanoid robots become increasingly integrated into human environments, ethical considerations and safety measures become paramount. This chapter examines the ethical implications, safety requirements, and regulatory frameworks necessary for the responsible development and deployment of humanoid robots in society.

## Introduction to Ethics and Safety in Robotics

The integration of humanoid robots into human society raises fundamental questions about safety, privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. Unlike industrial robots operating in isolated environments, humanoid robots interact directly with humans in shared spaces, making ethical and safety considerations critical to their design, development, and deployment.
